                <h2>What Semantic HTML means?</h2>
                <p>
                    Semantic HTML is language that introduces meaning to the web page
                    rather than just presentation. For example, a 'p' tag indicates that
                    the enclosed text is a paragraph, Header tags 'h1' through 'h6'.It is
                    also called semantic markup. Semantic HTML is the correct use of HTML
                    to reinforce the meaning of content on a web page, rather than merely
                    define its appearance.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Why Do You Need to Use Semantic Tags in HTML?</h4>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                      It help the search engines and other user devices to determine the
                      importance and context of web pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The pages made with semantic elements are much easier to read.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It has greater accessibility. It offers a better user experience
                    </li>
                  </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="contentlist">
                <h2>
                    Why is writing our internal styling in the head the best rather than
                    writing in the body?
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    A style element inside the body element violates HTML syntax rules,
                    except that according to HTML5 drafts, it is allowed in some
                    conditions, if the scoped attributes is present. It is recommended
                    because when you have the CSS declared before body starts, the styles
                    will be loaded already. So something appeared quickly on the user's
                    screen. Otherwise, users see blank screen for some time before the CSS
                    reaches the user. Also, if you leave the styles somewhere in the body,
                    the browser has to re-load the page when the styles declared has been
                    parsed.
